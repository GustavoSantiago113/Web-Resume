The resume was built in R using the Shiny framework because of the free deployment on shinyapps.io and because I desired to go beyond the simple dashboard development at work.

## Features

This resume will feature:
* Animations using CSS and JavaScript.
* A minimalist, fancy and straightforward design.
* Usage of functions to render multiple cards from databases.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this website comes from multiple sources around internet.
